Recently, machine learning (ML) based techniques have been applied to parts of the end-to-end three-step pipeline for workload prediction - feature selection, workload similarity, and performance prediction. However, despite its practical importance, there exists no principled analysis that studies the performance of such pipelines. In this paper, we examine the state-of-the-art strategies for these three components, with the goal of identifying which techniques work best in practice. Our experimental results reveal that while no universal solution exists for the prediction pipeline, certain best practices can improve prediction performance and reduce computation overhead. Based on our results, we outline important topics for future work that will benefit ML-driven recommendation systems for resource allocation.","tags":["Benchmarking and performance evaluation","ML/AI for DB"],"title":"From Feature Selection to Resource Prediction: An Analysis of Commonly Applied Workflows and Techniques","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ling Zhang","Shaleen Deep","Avrilia Floratou","Anja Gruenheid","Jignesh M.

In tasks like log processing, the speed of regex matching is crucial. Data scientists and developers regularly use regex libraries that implement optimized regular expression matching using modern automata theory. However, computing state transitions in the underlying regex evaluation engine can be inefficient when a regex query contains a multitude of string literals. This inefficiency is further exasperated when analyzing large data volumes. This paper presents BLARE, Blazingly Fast Regular Expression, a regular expression matching framework that is inspired by the mechanisms that are used in database engines, which use a declarative framework to explore multiple equivalent execution plans, all of which produce the correct final result. Similarly, BLARE decomposes a regex into multiple regex and string components and then creates evaluation strategies in which the components can be evaluated in an order that is not strictly a left-to-right translation of the input regex query. Rather than using a cost-based optimization approach, BLARE uses an adaptive runtime strategy based on a multi-armed bandit approach to find an efficient execution plan. BLARE is also modular and can be built on top of any existing regex library. We implemented BLARE on four commonly used regex libraries, RE2, PCRE2, Boost Regex, and ICU Regex, and evaluated it using two production workloads and one open-source workload. BLARE was 1.6x to 3.7x faster than RE2 and 3.4x to 7.9x faster than Boost Regex. PCRE2 did not finish on one of the workloads, but on the remaining two workloads, BLARE improved the performance of PCRE2 by 3.1x to over 100x. For the open-source dataset, BLARE provided a speed up of 61.7x for ICU Regex. BLARE code is publicly available at https://github.com/mush-zhang/Blare.","tags":["regular expression","adaptive query processing","structured text search","database query processing"],"title":"Exploiting Structure in Regular Expression Queries","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ling Zhang","Matthew Butrovich","Tianyu Li","Yash Nannapanei","Andrew Pavlo","John Rollinson","Huanchen Zhang","Ambarish Balakumar","Daniel Biales","Ziqi Dong","Emmanuel Eppinger","Jordi Gonzalez","Wan Shen Lim","Jianqiao Liu","Lin Ma","Prashanth Menon","Soumil Mukherjee","Tanuj Nayak","Amadou Ngom","Jeff Niu","Deepayan Patra","Poojita Raj","Stephanie Wang","Wuwen Wang","Yao Yu","William Zhang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1608076800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1608076800,"objectID":"0d8b5b3a46730315554bb1c0e01f4b25","permalink":"https://mush-zhang.github.io/homepage/publication/daf/","publishdate":"2020-12-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/homepage/publication/daf/","section":"publication","summary":"Almost every database management system (DBMS) supporting transactions created in the last decade implements multi-version concurrency control (MVCC). But these systems rely on physical data structures (e.g., B+trees, hash tables) that do not natively support multi-versioning. As a result, there is a disconnect between the logical semantics of transactions and the DBMS’s underlying implementation. System developers must invest in engineering efforts to coordinate transactional access to these data structures and non-transactional maintenance tasks. This burden leads to challenges when reasoning about the system’s correctness and performance and inhibits its modularity. In this paper, we propose the Deferred Action Framework (DAF), a new system architecture for scheduling maintenance tasks in an MVCC DBMS integrated with the system’s transactional semantics. DAF allows the system to register arbitrary actions and then defer their processing until they are deemed safe by transactional processing. We show that DAF can support garbage collection and index cleaning without compromising performance while facilitating higher-level implementation goals, such as non-blocking schema changes and self-driving optimizations.","tags":["resource management","adaptive query processing","structured text search","database query processing"],"title":"Everything is a Transaction: Unifying Logical Concurrency Control and Physical Data Structure Maintenance in Database Management Systems","type":"publication"}]
